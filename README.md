# DEPRECATED: Not Complete

This module was never completed due to time constraints. It is specific to Tripal 2 and thus is no longer recommended for use.

### KnowPulse Cross Management System
This module provides a number of forms and listings to aid breeders and associated staff in keeping track of the crosses to 
make and the resulting progeny. First, the breeders specify what should be done with the progeny from the previous crossing 
block (should it become a parent in this crossing block and if so, whom should it be crossed with? should some of the seed 
simply be advanced to the next generation?). They also specify what germplasm they intend to use as parents in the current 
crossing block and what crosses should be made. Then after the crosses have been made and the seeds collected, the progeny 
of the crossing block are entered into the system and given unique identifiers. In addition to the workflow just described
there are a number of specialized listings describing the crossing block and aiding in carrying out of plans.
